ABSTRACT 

Patient readmissions in hospitals pose significant challenges to healthcare systems and patient outcomes. Reducing unnecessary readmissions can lead to improved patient care, cost savings, and better allocation of resources. This project aims to address the problem of predicting the likelihood of patient readmissions in hospitals using machine learning models. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of diabetic patients, I employ various predictive models to identify factors influencing readmissions and develop accurate prediction models.
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a comprehensive dataset of diabetic patients, encompassing demographics, medical history, medications, and encounter information. By conducting rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, my aim is to develop robust prediction models capable of accurately identifying patients at risk of readmission. The dataset provides valuable insights into diabetic patient characteristics and their hospital readmission patterns, enabling us to contribute to the field by enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of readmission prediction models.
Our models achieve high accuracy values, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of 0.97, Random Forest with 0.98, LightGBM with 0.97, and XGBoost with 0.97. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of my approach in accurately predicting patient readmissions.
The findings from this project contribute to the growing body of literature on readmission prediction and provide insights into the factors influencing patient outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. The developed models have the potential to guide healthcare professionals in making informed decisions to improve patient care and enhance hospital management strategies. By understanding and preventing unnecessary readmissions, my work aims to contribute to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.
