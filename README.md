Predicting Patient Readmissions in Hospitals: A Machine Learning Approach
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition characterized by insufficient production and secretion of insulin from the pancreas in cases of Type-1 diabetes, and defective response to insulin in Type-2 diabetes. It is a prevalent health concern worldwide. Hospital readmission for diabetic patients is a significant issue, particularly in the United States, where over $250 million was spent on treating readmitted diabetic inpatients in 2011 alone.

Objective
The objective of this project is to address the challenge of hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Hospital readmissions have become an important quality indicator for hospitals and can substantially impact the cost of care. High readmission rates can lead to penalties for hospitals and indicate potential shortcomings in the healthcare system. Therefore, the primary goal is to identify the key factors influencing readmissions for diabetes and predict the probability of patient readmission.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI website. It encompasses patient data spanning a decade from 130 different hospitals. To obtain the dataset, follow these steps:

Visit the UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008.
Download the dataset files and save them to your project directory.
Usage
To use the provided Python code for your analysis and predictions, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib xgboost
Open the Python code file named predict_readmissions.py.

Replace 'path_to_dataset.csv' with the actual path to the downloaded dataset CSV file in the code.

Run the code using your preferred Python environment or IDE.

Key Features
Machine Learning: The project employs state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict readmission probabilities.

Python Ecosystem: The code is written in Python, harnessing the capabilities of popular libraries such as scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset, identifying trends and patterns that influence patient readmissions.

Healthcare Impact: By predicting patient readmission probabilities, this project aims to contribute to healthcare improvements by assisting hospitals in reducing readmission rates and enhancing the overall quality of care.
